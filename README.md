# Dotter

This is a small dotfile manager and templater.

**Important note:** Dotter has been recently ported to Rust.
Configuration is now different. Check out examples.

Find out help with `./dotter -h`.
To run the example, you can use `./dotter -d example deploy`

Variables are templated by putting `{{ VAR_NAME }}` in any file, and it will be
replaced with the configured value.

Feel free to fork/pull request/open any issues, especially now, since I am a rust newbie :)
