# Dotter
This is a small dotfile manager and templater.

Find out help with `./dotter -h`.
To run the example, you can use `./dotter -d example`

Variables are templated by putting `{{ VAR_NAME }}` in any file, and it will be
replaced with the configured value.

Feel free to fork/pull request/open any issues. :)
